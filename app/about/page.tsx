        The past 15 years working in the education sector have been very informative of the critical issues pointing to poor quality, accessibility and equitable education for the children in Uganda.
        Most of the school going children in Uganda — over 80% — go to public government aided schools which don’t have the pre-school services.
        This has led to population explosions in most primary schools especially in grade 1-3 and subsequent drop out by grade 7, leaving only about 40% completing the cycle.

        Denis and Decimon, as teachers and instructional coaches, realized how difficult it would be for children in these congested classrooms to compete academically.
        Supported by data from Uganda Bureau of Statistics and EMIS, over 60% of children aged 3-5 were not attending school, which motivated the foundation of ICC pre-schools.
